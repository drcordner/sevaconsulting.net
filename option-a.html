        </header>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>If you're a founder, CTO, or senior leader in a growing technology business, you probably don't fit neatly into anyone else's category.</p>
            <p>You're not just managing. You're building, deciding, carrying risk, and holding responsibility that doesn't show up in a job description.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you need space to think. Sometimes you need someone to challenge your assumptions. Sometimes you need an experienced eye on the thing you're trying to build - before you commit to it.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>What I help with</h2>
            <p>I work with technical leaders on both the personal and the organisational.</p>
            <p>On the personal side: role clarity, decision-making under pressure, difficult conversations, and the inner shifts that come with growing a business. Most people I work with arrive carrying some version of "what is my job supposed to be at this stage?" - and the answer is rarely what they expect.</p>
            <p>On the organisational side: I act as a sounding board and reviewer for the things you're building - vision documents, leadership structures, role definitions, engineering values, delivery challenges. I don't implement or own outcomes. I help you think more clearly before you decide.</p>
            <p>I am approached directly by technical leaders, but sometimes I'm brought in by co-founders or investors who sense something isn't quite right. Often the real issue isn't what it first appears to be.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How I work</h2>
            <p>I take on a small number of clients for ongoing work.</p>
            <p>Typically this looks like weekly conversations over a period of months, with occasional document review or advisory input between sessions. This isn't coaching-by-checklist or consulting-by-deliverable. It's a relationship built on trust, depth, and honest challenge - with you always holding responsibility for outcomes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who I work with</h2>
            <p>Mostly founder-CTOs and senior technical leaders in growing technology businesses. Occasionally CEOs or COOs where the challenges are similar - navigating growth, ownership, and the gap between where they are and where the business now needs them to be.</p>
            <p>I work remotely, one-to-one. No workshops. No team facilitation. No on-site programmes.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I'm David Cordner.</p>
                <p>I've spent over 30 years in technology, including building and selling a technology business over 21 years. I've lived the transition from maker to leader - and from leader to owner - more than once.</p>
                <p>Today I work with others navigating that same shift, helping them build organisations that don't depend entirely on them.</p>
