            <p class="value-proposition">Confidential one-to-one advisory for founder-CTOs and senior engineering leaders navigating growth, complexity and pressure.</p>
        </header>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>If you are a founder, CTO or senior technical leader, you are likely carrying more than most people see. Operational detail, strategic direction, commercial pressure and team dynamics all sit with you.</p>
            <p>The challenge is not just knowing what to do. It is staying steady, trusting your judgement and leading in a way that scales with the business.</p>

            <h2>What I help with</h2>
            <p>Most of my clients come to me with some version of the same question: "What is my job supposed to be at this stage?"
			They're capable, respected, and quietly stuck. They're doing too much, struggling to let go, and wondering if they're the problem.</p>
            <p>What most clients value is the combination of validation, support and challenge. A place to test their thinking safely, and have it pushed when it needs to be.</p>
            <p>Usually they're not. They're just operating from an old map in new territory.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I'm brought in by co-founders or investors who sense something isn't quite right. Often the real issue isn't what it first appears to be.</p>
            <p>I work as a thinking partner. Someone outside the pressure who can help you see patterns, make sense of what's actually happening, and figure out where to focus.
			We work on role clarity, decision-making, difficult conversations, and the inner shifts that make sustainable leadership possible.</p>

            <h2>How I work</h2>
            <p>I take on a small number of clients for ongoing work. Typically this looks like weekly conversations, for as long as they're valuable.
			This isn't coaching-by-checklist. It's a relationship built on trust and depth, where real change becomes possible.</p>
            <ul class="work-list">
                <li>One-to-one, private conversations.</li>
                <li>Clear thinking on strategic, organisational and people decisions.</li>
                <li>Practical support between sessions when needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who I work with</h2>
            <p>Mostly founder-CTOs and senior technical leaders in growing technology businesses.
			Occasionally CEOs or COOs where the challenges are similar - navigating growth, ownership,
			and the gap between where they are and where the business now needs them to be.</p>
            <p>I work remotely, one-to-one. No workshops. No team facilitation. No on-site programmes.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Good fit if...</h2>
            <ul class="fit-list">
                <li>You are carrying too much context and decision load yourself.</li>
                <li>You know your leadership approach has to evolve for the next stage.</li>
                <li>You want experienced challenge, not generic coaching scripts.</li>
            </ul>

			  <h2>Background</h2>
			  <p>I'm David Cordner.</p>
			  <p>I have spent over 30 years in technology, including building and selling a software business over 21 years. I have lived the shift from maker to leader, and from leader to owner, more than once.</p>
			  <p>That experience means I'm not guessing. I've seen product, delivery, hiring, growth and client pressure from the inside.</p>
			  <p>Today I work one-to-one with technical leaders navigating that same territory -
			  helping them get clear on their role, lead without carrying everything themselves, and build organisations that don't depend entirely on them.</p>
