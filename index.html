        <div class="intro">
            <p>If you are a founder, CTO or senior technical leader, you are likely carrying more than most people see. Operational detail, strategic direction, commercial pressure and team dynamics all sit with you, and they constantly pull against each other.</p>
            <p>The challenge is not just knowing what to do. It is staying steady, trusting your judgement and leading in a way that scales with the business.</p>

            <h2>What I help with</h2>
            <p>Most of my clients come to me with some version of the same question: "What is my job supposed to be at this stage?"
			They're capable, respected, and <strong>quietly stuck</strong>. They're doing too much, struggling to let go, and wondering if they're the problem.</p>
            <p>Usually they're not. The role has changed, but the way they're working hasn't caught up.</p>
            <p>I work as a thinking partner. Someone outside the pressure who can help you see patterns, make sense of what's actually happening, and figure out where to focus.
			Sometimes I'm brought in by co-founders or investors who sense something isn't quite right, and often the real issue isn't what it first appears to be.
			However it starts, the work is a combination of <strong>validation, support and challenge</strong>. A place to test your thinking safely, and have it pushed when it needs to be.</p>
            <p>Together, we work on role clarity, decision-making, difficult conversations, and on helping you lead as yourself, not a version of someone else.</p>

            <h2>How I work</h2>
            <p>I take on a small number of clients for ongoing work. Typically this looks like weekly conversations, for as long as they're valuable.
			This isn't coaching-by-checklist. It's a relationship built on trust and depth, where real change becomes possible.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who I work with</h2>
            <p>Mostly founder-CTOs and senior technical leaders in growing technology businesses.
			Occasionally CEOs or COOs where the challenges are similar - navigating growth, ownership,
			and the gap between where they are and where the business now needs them to be.</p>
            <p>I work remotely, one-to-one. This isn't workshops, team facilitation or on-site programmes.</p>

			  <h2>Background</h2>
			  <p>I'm David Cordner.</p>
			  <p>I have spent over 30 years in technology, including building a software business over 21 years and leading it through to a successful exit. I have lived the shift from maker to leader, and from leader to owner, more than once.</p>
			  <p>That experience means I'm not guessing. I've seen product, delivery, hiring, growth and client pressure from the inside.</p>
			  <p>Today I work one-to-one with technical leaders navigating that same territory, helping them get clear on their role, lead without carrying everything themselves, and build organisations that don't depend entirely on them.</p>
