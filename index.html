            <h1>I work with technical leaders who need space to think clearly about what they’re building, and how they’re leading, as their business evolves.</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>If you built something real, and now find yourself in a business that's outgrown your old way of working, you're not alone. 
			The skills that got you here - deep technical ability, high standards, doing whatever it takes - can start to work against you. 
			The role has changed, but there is no manual.</p>
			<p>My background is as a founder and technical leader in a growing software business, now working one-to-one after selling my business.</p>

            <h2>What I help with</h2>
            <p>Most of my clients come to me with some version of the same question: "What is my job supposed to be at this stage?" 
			They're capable, respected, and quietly stuck. They're doing too much, struggling to let go, and wondering if they're the problem.</p>
            <p>Usually they're not. They're just operating from an old map in new territory.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I'm brought in by co-founders or investors who sense something isn't quite right. Often the real issue isn't what it first appears to be.</p>
            <p>I work as a thinking partner. Someone outside the pressure who can help you see patterns, make sense of what's actually happening, and figure out where to focus. 
			We work on role clarity, decision-making, difficult conversations, and the inner shifts that make sustainable leadership possible.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>How I work</h2>
            <p>I take on a small number of clients for ongoing work. Typically this looks like weekly conversations, for as long as they're valuable. 
			This isn't coaching-by-checklist. It's a relationship built on trust and depth, where real change becomes possible.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who I work with</h2>
            <p>Mostly founder-CTOs and senior technical leaders in growing technology businesses. 
			Occasionally CEOs or COOs where the challenges are similar - navigating growth, ownership, 
			and the gap between where they are and where the business now needs them to be.</p>
            <p>I work remotely, one-to-one. No workshops. No team facilitation. No on-site programmes.</p>

			  <h2>Background</h2>
			  <p>I'm David Cordner.</p>
			  <p>I've spent over 30 years in technology. For two decades I built and ran a software business through the full arc: 
			  product, delivery, hiring, growth, client pressure, and the inevitable shifts in what leadership requires as the company matures.</p>
			  <p>That experience means I’m not guessing. I’ve lived the transition from maker to leader, from leader to owner, and from urgency to deliberate decision-making.</p>
			  <p>Today I work one-to-one with technical leaders navigating that same territory - 
			  helping them get clear on their role, lead without carrying everything themselves, and build organisations that don't depend entirely on them.</p>
